# src/components

The components directory should hold components that are intended for use throughout the application. Typically, each component should have its own directory, including a general component file along with its associated styles

```
src
└── components
        ├── demo
        │   ├── demo.tsx
        │   └── demo.scss
        └── example
            ├── example.tsx
            └── example.scss
```
